# Creative Coding Portfolio Experiments
This github serves as a place for all three of my creative coding exercises. All of these projects will be written with p5.js.

### Exp 1 - Moire effect
This experiment aimed to create a moire effect using four different patterns. 

### Exp 2 - Mouse-driven Painting Tool
This experiment created a painting tool with a Pen, Eraser, a "Chaos" tool which places random lines and dots around the canvas, and utility tools such as a save button and a clear button.

### Exp 3 - One-key competitive game
This experiment produced an autorunner game that allows two players to press a key to jump, with a "kill cube" randomly spawning for them to fight for. The players and walls will have collision.

# Creative Coding Portfolio Experiments
This github serves as a place for all three of my creative coding exercises. All of these projects will be written with p5.js.

### [Exp 1 - Moire effect](Exp1.md)
This experiment aimed to create a moire effect using four different patterns. 

### [Exp 2 - Mouse-driven Painting Tool](Exp2.md)
This experiment created a painting tool with a Pen, Eraser, a "Chaos" tool which places random shapes around the canvas, and utility tools such as a save button and a clear button.

### [Exp 3 - One-key competitive game](Exp3.md)
This experiment produced an autorunner game that allows two players to press a key to jump, with a "kill cube" randomly spawning for them to fight for. The players and walls will have collision.

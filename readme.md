# Creative Coding Portfolio Experiments
This github serves as a place for all three of my creative coding exercises. All of these projects will be written with p5.js.

### Exp 1 - Realtime Audio Visualiser
This experiment will aim to create a 2D or 3D visualiser with a line or circle of balls that bounce to the music. It will also allow the user to input a link to the audio file for custom audio.

### Exp 2 - Mouse-driven Painting Tool
This experiment will produce a painting tool with a pen, eraser, fill tool and a text tool.

### Exp 3 - One-key competitive game
This experiment will produce an autorunner game that allows two players to press a key to jump, with a weapon randomly spawning for them to fight for. The players and walls will have collision.

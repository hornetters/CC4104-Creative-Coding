# Experiment 1 - Moire effect
This is my first experiment that aims to outline the moire effect. The brief for this experiment is to "Experiment with the moire effect. Create 3 variations or experiments that change over time or change with the mouse". My take on the "change over time" statement was to have the user control the effect using a css slider at the top of their screen. As such, I created 4 different patterns that the user can toggle on and off with buttons to mix and match the patterns for different effects. These buttons are accompanied with their own sliders, moving the shapes associated with them from side to side.
